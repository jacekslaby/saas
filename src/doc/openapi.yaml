    This is Command API for Source Alarms repository. ('C' from 'CQRS')
    
    It accepts requests modyfining Alarms stored in Source Alarms repository.
    
    A request may concern a single Alarm (e.g. `CreateAlarm` request)
     or all Alarms from an Adapter (e.g. `DeleteAll` request).
    Stored Alarms are partitioned by tuple (DomainName, AdapterName).
    Within a partition (i.e. among alarms from the same Adapter)
     an Alarm is uniquely identified by its property `notification_identifier`.
     
    Every request has an optional `uuid` which may be used in Query API of Source Alarms repository.
    Every request concerning a single Alarm must provide property `notification_identifier`.
    
    Clients using this API must be ready for backward compatible changes in API like
     adding a not required property, adding a new request type, adding a new path, 
     adding a new HTTP method, adding a new enum value.
     
    Note: including changes in order to workaround swagger-codegen bugs:
    - 'discriminator' is not properly supported by codegen - https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/1313
      
    Note: still unresolved:
    - missing imports in model code generaged by codegen - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/8642
    - when serialized to JSON (by jackson) instances of model.AlarmDTO generated by codegen do not have properties due to 'extends HashMap' - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47850441/openapi-swagger-codegen-additionnalproperties-extends-hashmap-playjackson-de
    - generated model.DeleteAlarm does not support DeleteAlarm.alarm_dto.notification_identifier

         an alarm needs to have at least one non-DeleteAlarm request
